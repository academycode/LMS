- **Team Name:** Escuela Blockchain.
- **Payment Address USDT:** XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.

## Project Overview

### OverviewB
Peer to peer learning

makes learning multiplayer 

Through the Internet, a lot of information is available, but access to information does not guarantee learning. In most educational systems, teachers are the ones who facilitate learning. They give feedback, evaluate student work, and preserve learning materials. Teachers are often the bottlenecks of education systems because they are difficult to scale up and in some cases very expensive. The Block academy could build a peer learning ecosystem in which learners, teachers, and tutors educate each other.

TheBlock.academy was born as a decentralized protocol focused on education and its participants, which allows creating and sharing spaces and content while preserving Intellectual Property, in addition to rewarding the good participation of users, people or institutions through Smart Contracts. Global censorship free. Through a Marketplace, training courses in the blockchain ecosystem, which allow participants to acquire knowledge focused on the development of technological solutions that contribute to the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem.

Education is the backbone for creating critical mass and global social well-being. Interconnection without barriers is now possible. The Learning Platform allowed the integration of facilitators and students in the teaching-learning process, the system based on rewards for each level passed, and based on game theory, all who participate are rewarded.
From the meaning of paper money to a Metaverse, there are too many stages of learning into the unknown for most. Inclusion and Social Impact are a mandatory part of this early adoption process
