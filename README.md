Project LMS

Education is the backbone for creating critical mass and global social well-being. Interconnection without barriers is now possible. The Learning Platform allowed the integration of facilitators and students in the teaching-learning process, the system based on rewards for each level passed, and based on game theory, all who participate are rewarded. From the meaning of paper money to a Metaverse, there are too many stages of learning into the unknown for most. Inclusion and Social Impact are a mandatory part of this early adoption process
